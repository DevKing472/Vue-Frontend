# Installation

To install the SDK, run the following command:

```bash
yarn add @vue-storefront/sdk
```

Explore the [Modules](../modules/index.md) page to discover a comprehensive list of all modules created or approved by Vue Storefront.

To create and incorporate a custom module in your project, refer to the [Custom integrations](./custom-integrations/) page for guidance.

Before initializing the SDK, ensure you have also installed the desired SDK modules for your project. For instance, to use the SAP Commerce Cloud module, you'll need to install it as well:

```bash
yarn add @vsf-enterprise/sapcc-sdk
```

:::warning Installation processes may vary
The installation process for each module varies and may necessitate additional package installations. Be sure to consult the installation guide for the specific module you intend to use.
