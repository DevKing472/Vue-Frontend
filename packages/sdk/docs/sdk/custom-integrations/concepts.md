## What is an integration?

An integration is code that connects Vue Storefront with your custom backend or third-party service providers. 
Custom backends are usually built using a headless CMS or a headless eCommerce platform.
Integrations consists of functions that retrieve data from your service provider and return it as raw data, as well as functions that send data to your custom backend or third-party service providers.

Typically, an integration includes two components:

- API client: A server-side client that establishes server-to-server communication with your custom backend.
- SDK module: A module that forms a communication layer with the API client, used by the frontend application.
