# Checkout.com Nuxt module
## How to install
1. Open your `nuxt.config.js`
2. At the bottom of `modules` add:
```js
['@vue-storefront/checkout-com/nuxt', { publicKey: 'pk_test_your-public-key' }],
```

## Credit card component
1. Import `useCkoCard`:
```js
import { useCkoCard } from '@vue-storefront/checkout-com';
```

2. `useCkoCard` returns:
```ts
interface {
    error: Error | null,
    submitDisabled: Boolean,
    submitForm: async(),
    makePayment: async({ cartId }),
    initForm: (): void
}
```

In this step you need:
```js
const { submitForm, submitDisabled, initForm } = useCkoCard();
```

3. Execute `initForm` in `setup`. It will set `submitDisabled` to true and create Card Component in `onMounted` hook.
4. When `submitDisabled` changes to false - it means provided Card's data is proper and you could allow your user go forward. Card's token will be stored in localStorage for a moment.

## Finalizing payment
1. In this step you need:
```js
const { makePayment, error: paymentError } = useCkoCard();
const { cart } = useCart();
const {
    placeOrder
} = useCheckout();
```

`error` - contains error message from the response if you do not use 3ds or we have some server related issues. If the user just removed stored token from localStorage it will have `There is no payment token` inside.
`makePayment` - it proceeds with the payment and removes card token afterward. Returns Promise<Payment> if succeed, or Promise<null> if failed.

2. You should `makePayment` at first (remember to check if everything went ok):
```js
const payment = await makePayment({ cartId: cart.value.id });
if (!payment) return;
```

3. If so, place an order:
```js
const order = await placeOrder();
```

4. `payment.data.redirect_url` contains 3DS Auth redirect url if it is required by bank. You have to support it:
```js
if (payment.data.redirect_url) {
    window.location.href = payment.data.redirect_url;
    return;
}
```

5. After 3DS Auth, user will be redirected to one of these urls. They are being created inside `makePayment` method:
```js
success_url: `${window.location.origin}/cko/payment-success`,
failure_url: `${window.location.origin}/cko/payment-error`
```
