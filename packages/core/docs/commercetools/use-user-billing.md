## Features

`useUserBilling` composable can be used to:

* fetch existing billing addresses,
* submit new billing addresses,
* modify and delete existing billing addresses.

## API

- `load` - function for fetching user addresses. When invoked, it requests data from the API and populates `billing` property.

- `addAddress` - function for posting new billing address.

```typescript
interface BillingAddressAddParams {
  address: {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    streetName: string;
    postalCode: string;
    city: string;
    state: string;
    country: string;
    apartment: string;
    phone: string;
    isDefault?: boolean;
  }
}
```

- `deleteAddress` - function for deleting existing billing address.

```typescript
interface BillingAddressDeleteParams {
  address: {
    id: string;
  }
}
```

- `updateAddress` - function for updating existing billing address.

```typescript
interface BillingAddressUpdateParams {
  address: {
    id: string;
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    streetName: string;
    postalCode: string;
    city: string;
    state: string;
    country: string;
    apartment: string;
    phone: string;
    isDefault?: boolean;
  }
}
```

- `setDefaultAddress` - function for settings an existing billing address as default.

```typescript
interface BillingAddressSetDefaultParams {
  address: {
    id: string;
  }
}
```
- `billing` - reactive data object containing response from the backend.

- `loading` - reactive object containing information about loading state of `load`, `addAddress`, `deleteAddress`, `updateAddress` and `setDefaultAddress` methods.

## Example

```typescript
import { onSSR } from '@vue-storefront/core';
import { useUserBilling, userBillingGetters } from '@vsf-enterprise/ct-billing';

export default {
  setup() {
    const {
      billing,
      load,
      addAddress,
      deleteAddress,
      updateAddress
    } = useUserBilling();

    // If you're using Nuxt or any other framework for Universal Vue apps
    onSSR(async () => {
      await load();
    });

    return {
      billing: computed(() => userBillingGetters.getAddresses(billing.value)),
      userBillingGetters
    };
  }
};
```

Providing custom GraphQL query and variables:

```typescript
await addAddress(addParams, (query, variables) => ({ query, variables }));
await deleteAddress(deleteParams, (query, variables) => ({ query, variables }));
await updateAddress(updateParams, (query, variables) => ({ query, variables }));
```
