```

## Enumeration Members

|  Member | Value | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  GiftLineItem | <code>&quot;GiftLineItem&quot;</code> | The line item was added automatically, because a discount has added a free gift to the cart. The quantity can not be increased, and it won’t be merged when the same product variant is added. If the gift is removed, an entry is added to the "refusedGifts" array and the discount won’t be applied again to the cart. The price can not be changed externally. All other updates, such as the ones related to custom fields, can be used. |
|  Standard | <code>&quot;Standard&quot;</code> | The line item was added during cart creation or with the update action addLineItem. Its quantity can be changed without restrictions. |
