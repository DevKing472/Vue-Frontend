## TaxPortion type

Represents the portions that sum up to the totalGross field of a TaxedPrice. The portions are calculated from the TaxRates. If a tax rate has SubRates, they are used and can be identified by name. Tax portions from line items that have the same rate and name will be accumulated to the same tax portion.
