```

## Enumeration Members

|  Member | Value | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  None | <code>&quot;None&quot;</code> | Adding items to cart and ordering is independent of inventory. No inventory checks or modifications. This is the default mode for a new cart. |
|  ReserveOnOrder | <code>&quot;ReserveOnOrder&quot;</code> | Creating an order will fail with an OutOfStock error if an unavailable line item exists. Line items in the cart are only reserved for the duration of the ordering transaction. |
|  TrackOnly | <code>&quot;TrackOnly&quot;</code> | Orders are tracked on inventory. That means, ordering a LineItem will decrement the available quantity on the respective InventoryEntry. Creating an order will succeed even if the line itemâ€™s available quantity is zero or negative. But creating an order will fail with an OutOfStock error if no matching inventory entry exists for a line item. |
