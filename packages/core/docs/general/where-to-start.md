## Integrator

If you are using a custom backend or want to use platforms or technologies not listed on our [Integrations](../integrations/) page, you likely need to create an integration.

Vue Storefront integrates with a wide range of technologies and each has its own needs, so there is no generic tutorial for all of them.

However, depending on the kind of integrations you want to build, you should familiarize yourself with **Building Integration** section. Especially integration guide for [eCommerce](../integrate/integration-guide.html) and [CMS](../integrate/cms.html) platforms.

**eCommerce** section will guide you through: 
- [introduction](../integrate/integration-guide.html#introduction)
- [scope](../integrate/integration-guide.html#scope)
- [getting started](../integrate/integration-guide.html#getting-started)
- [creating an api-client](../integrate/integration-guide.html#creating-an-api-client)
- [creating composables](../integrate/integration-guide.html#creating-composables)
- [creating getters](../integrate/integration-guide.html#creating-getters)
- [creating a theme](../integrate/integration-guide.html#creating-a-theme)

**CMS** section will guide you through:
- [configuration / content fetching / content rendering](../integrate/cms.html#what-is-needed)
- [usage example in the real application](../integrate/cms.html#usage-example-in-the-real-application)

## Designer creating a theme

Vue Storefront default theme is mostly based on Single UI components turned into a powerful design system for e-commerce we called [Storefront UI](https://www.storefrontui.io/)

If you don't want to use [Storefront UI](https://www.storefrontui.io/) (it's just a UI layer), the project can work with any other UI library or a custom code. So it totally depends on you - create your own theme, edit the existing one or use our default theme.

At the start you should familiarize yourself with the specially prepared [theme](../guide/theme.html) guide.

**Theme** section will guide you through:
- [directory structure](../guide/theme.html#directory-structure)
- [Storefront UI](../guide/theme.html#directory-structure)
- [how to customizing the theme](../guide/theme.html#customizing-the-theme)
- [routing](../guide/theme.html#routing)
- [how to updating styles](../guide/theme.html#updating-styles)
- [preinstalled modules and libraries](../guide/theme.html#preinstalled-modules-and-libraries)
