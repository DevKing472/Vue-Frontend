- `getAddresses` - returns list of shipping addresses.

- `getDefault` - returns a default shipping address.

- `getTotal` - returns total number of shipping addresses user has.

- `getId` - returns id from an individual address.

- `getStreetName` - returns street name from an individual address.

- `getStreetNumber` - returns street number from an individual address.

- `getCity` - returns city name from an individual address.

- `getFirstName` - returns first name from an individual address.

- `getLastName` - returns last name from an individual address.

- `getCountry` - returns country name from an individual address.

- `getPhone` - return phone number from an individual address.

- `getEmail` - returns e-mail address from an individual address.

- `getCompanyName` - returns company name from an individual address.

- `getTaxNumber` - returns tax number from an individual address.

- `getApartmentNumber` - returns apartment number from an individual address.

- `isDefault` - return information if address is current default.

Interface for the above getter looks like this:

```typescript

export interface UserShippingGetters<USER_SHIPPING, USER_SHIPPING_ITEM> {
  // Getters for 'shipping' data object
  getAddresses: (shipping: USER_SHIPPING, criteria?: Record<string, any>) => USER_SHIPPING_ITEM[];
  getDefault: (shipping: USER_SHIPPING) => USER_SHIPPING_ITEM;
  getTotal: (shipping: USER_SHIPPING) => number;

  // Getters for individual addresses
  getId: (address: USER_SHIPPING_ITEM) => string | number;
  getPostCode: (address: USER_SHIPPING_ITEM) => string;
  getStreetName: (address: USER_SHIPPING_ITEM) => string;
  getStreetNumber: (address: USER_SHIPPING_ITEM) => string | number;
