## The business challenges

Vue Storefront was created to solve a set of key business challenges from the world of the shopping experience. Our goal for the application is to provide the solution with:

- The ultrafast front-end for the store - with the PWA approach we can now render the catalog of products within milliseconds;
- The endurance for traffic overloads on the store;
- The off-line shopping capabilities;
- The smooth shopping experience close to the user experience from the native mobile applications;
- The all-in-one front-end for desktop and mobile screens with no necessity for maintaining 3 or more applications for different touchpoints (web browser, Android, iOS etc.).
- Rapid development without architecture limitations.


## The headless architecture

## Concerns when hosting
When hosting NodeJS applications there are some differences compared to, for example, hosting PHP or Java applications.
Server Side Rendering via NodeJS can have memory leaks because of suboptimal code. Although core code is optimized, project specific features or misaligned hosting configuration can introduce this. More on how to avoid these for VueJS can be ready in [this article](https://vuejs.org/v2/cookbook/avoiding-memory-leaks.html). We also recommend reading about [VueJS best practices](https://blog.usejournal.com/vue-js-best-practices-c5da8d7af48d).

 On the server we advice to run [PM2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/) which offers features to keep your NodeJS application stable. When hosting on Kubernetes the checks and memory limits can be leveraged to kill unhealthy containers.
More on hosting can be found in [the documentation](https://docs.vuestorefront.io/guide/installation/production-setup.html#production-setup-bare-vps).

## Other platforms
Vue Storefront is platform agnostic which means it can be connected to virtually any CMS. Please take a look at [Pimcore bridge](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/coreshop-vsbridge) to give you an idea of how other platforms can be connected. Any support for integrating Prestashop, Shopify ... - much appreciated.
