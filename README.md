# Vue Storefront - PWA for eCommerce
Vue Storefront is a standalone PWA storefront for your eCommerce, possible to connect with any eCommerce backend (eg. Magento, [Pimcore](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/pimcore2vuestorefront),  Prestashop or Shopware) through the API.

Vue Storefront is and always will be in the open source. Anyone can use and support the project, we want it to be a tool for the improvement of the shopping experience.
The project is in the **production ready** phase. 

**We are looking for Contributors and Designer willing to help us in the solution development.**

## The business challenges
Vue Storefront was created to solve a set of key business challenges from the world of shopping experience. Our goal for the application is to provide the solution with:
* The ultrafast front-end for the store - with the PWA approach we can now render the catalog of products within milliseconds;
* The endurance for traffic overloads on the store;
* The off-line shopping capabilities;
* The smooth shopping experience close to the user experience from the native mobile applications;
* The all-in-one front-end for desktop and mobile screens with no necessity for maintaining 3 or more applications for different touchpoints (web browser, Android, iOS etc.).
* Rapid development without architecture limitations.

## The technology
Vue Storefront was built as an all-in-one front-end for eCommerce. For providing the best performance we decided to use Vue.js as a front-end library, Node.js + Express (and maybe GraphQL support) as a server-API, Elastic Search as a database of products and full PWA/off-line support.
Here you can read more about the proof of concept for [Vue Storefront connected with Magento2](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/magento2-nosql-database-pwa-support-piotr-karwatka).

Besides a big improvement for the shopping experience, we also want to create a great code base for every developer who needs to work on a front-end application for the eCommerce.

## The architecture
![Architecture diagram](doc/media/Vue-storefront-architecture.png)

## The design
The application is prepared to be fully customized in design through theming system.
With the current version we work on raw, basic template of typical eCommerce for a fashion industry.
In the project we used [Material Icons](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons).

Here you can read more about the process of [designing PWA for eCommerce](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/designing-pwa-ecommerce-karl-bzik/).

The design is available in open source in the Figma file format under the URL https://www.figma.com/file/VKyqbHFI55TKIKcQlFLiVpVF/Vue-Storefront-Open-Source.

## Other platforms
Vue Storefront is platform agnostic which means it can be connected to virtually any CMS. Please take a look at [Pimcore bridge](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/pimcore2vuestorefront) to give you an idea on how other platforms can be connected. Any support for integrating Prestashop, Shopify ... - much appreciated.
