We've marked some issues as "Easy first pick" to make it easier for newcomers to begin!

Thank you for your interest in, and engagement!

Before you type an issue please read about out [release lifecycle](https://docs.vuestorefront.io/guide/basics/project-structure.html)

# Branches

The main branches used by the core team are:

- master - where we store the stable release of the app (that can be deployed to our demo instances),
- develop - the most recent version of the app - kind of "nightly" build.
- RC-x (`x` is current version) - release candidate branch with features that will land in next version.

Please use "develop" or "RC" for development purposes as the "master" can be merged just as the new release is coming out (about once a month)!

## Issue reporting guidelines:

Always define type of issue:
* Bug report
* Feature request

While writing issues, be as specific as possible
All requests regarding support with implementation or application setup should be sent to contributors@vuestorefront.io

**Tag your issues properly**. If you found a bug tag it with `bug` label. If you're requesting new feature tag it with `feature request`  label.
