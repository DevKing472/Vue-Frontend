## 0. Introduction

_VueStorefront_ is getting tremendous attention from the market and gain traction from developers with more than 20 sites running on production. In the mean time, _VueStorefront_ framework evolves with each new release and the docs can hardly catch up with it! 

These training materials are a set of chief-recipes, experiences learned from the trenches. Iâ€™m trying to answer how to run _VueStorefront_ on production, troubleshoot most of the common problems and explain all the hidden features of _VueStorefront_ that can help you scale the application and solve most common issues.

Some topics here were taken from [frequently asked questions in our Forum](https://forum.vuestorefront.io/c/help). Some [came from Slack](http://slack.vuestorefront.io). Some came from core-consulting and our own works. One thing in common; each and every recipe is super-crucial for stable _VueStorefront_ run on production and they all cause some serious results when executed carelessly. 

## 1. Memory leaks
_VueStorefront_ consists of two Node.js applications:
- `vue-storefront` - which is the frontend app, with the entry point of [`core/scripts/server.js`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/4ed26d7f1978a9e798edcddf1cf2f970c3e64e4f/core/scripts/server.js#L269)
- `vue-storefornt-api` - which is backend/api app.

If you're familiar with PHP web application and running PHP on production, be it fastCGI or FPM, _Node.js_ works totally different way. It's not executing `node` process per each request but rather running an internal http server which serves all the subsequent requests. It's single threaded, long running task. That's why it's fairly easy to get into memory leaks problems; especially with the `vue-storefront` app which is far more complex than the API.

### Protip

#### 1. First thing first, monitor memory leaks
How do you know you have memory leaks undercover? 

Start with `yarn pm2 status` or `yarn pm2 monit` for details from _VueStorefront_ root directory. 

The `pm2` [memory usage](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/monitoring/) is growing with each page refresh.

_PM2_ restarts the process after [1GB of RAM (by default)](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/master/ecosystem.json#L5) is in use; This can be adjusted and together with multiple node `instances` set in `ecosystem.json`, it's pretty good work-around for memory leaks.

Additionally, there are many ways to trace memory leaks, however we're using the browser tools (Memory profile) most of the time. [Here you have it explained in details](https://marmelab.com/blog/2018/04/03/how-to-track-and-fix-memory-leak-with-nodejs.html). Another useful tools are [New Relic APM](http://newrelic.com) and [Google Trace](https://cloud.google.com/trace/docs/setup/nodejs)


#### 2. How to use Vue plugins

One thing you must avoid is using `Vue.use` multiple times and you can make it sure by calling it always inside `once`. In the _VueStorefront_ code you can pretty often find a snippet like this:

```js
import { once } from '@vue-storefront/core/helpers'
once('__VUE_EXTEND_RR__', () => {
  Vue.use(VueRouter)
})
```
This is a helper __helping__ you safely use plugins. Feel free to use it around with all your plugins and mixins instantiation. 

:::tip FURTHER STUDY
Vue.js docs has pretty good section on [how to avoid Vue.js memory leaks](https://vuejs.org/v2/cookbook/avoiding-memory-leaks.html). 
:::

#### 3. Handling _Events_ in a proper way

Another thing is to properly handle the events. Each `EventBus.$on` must have its corresponding `EventBus.$off`. You should be carefully turn them on and off in its life cycle.

Secondly, please avoid the situation where **you bind the event in `created` hook**  whenever possible.
The `created` is called in the SSR mode or server side in plain English; But if you bind in `beforeMount` it will be executed only in the CSR (which stands for Client Side Rendering or simply client's browser) which is 99% desired behavior and you won't risk the memory leaks on events.

#### 4. Stateful Singleton

Make sure you have `runInNewContext` set to `true` (default value!) in [`core/scripts/utils/ssr-renderer.js`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/master/core/scripts/utils/ssr-renderer.js#L16).

With setting it `false`, the [Stateful Singletons](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/issues/2664) like `RouteManager` or `i18n` we're using will cause the memory leaks at huuuuuge scale.


#### 5. Static pages generator

We do have **Static Pages Generator** - currently experimental feature - that can generate the whole site into a set of static HTML files so they could be served even directly from cloud provider/CDN - no memory leaks possible; waht you need to take care of in this mode is cache invalidation (not currently supported but easy to add). [Read more on static page generator](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/pull/3256).

#### 6. Learn from core team
In case you want to dig deeper any concern related to memory leaks, [find out how core teams have dealt with memory leaks](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+memory+is%3Aclosed+leak) in _VueStorefront_ core - and check if any of those edge cases solved can be an inspiration for your project.


<br />
<br />

## 2. SSR Output cache
_VueStorefront_ supports [Server Side Rendering](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/ssr.html). In this mode the same code which is executed in browser (CSR; Client Side Rendering), runs on the server in order to generate the HTML markup. The markup, then, gets transfered to the browser, rendered (extremly fast as the browsers have been all optimized to ... render html text in the last 20+ years) and [hydrated](https://ssr.vuejs.org/guide/hydration.html) from the [initial state](https://ssr.vuejs.org/guide/data.html#final-state-injection). During this whole procedure the client side or say browser scripts can use exactly the same code base universally. Another cool feature is that static HTML markup is well indexed by Search Engine crawlers which is extremely important for SEO.

Usually, _VueStorefront_ works pretty fast and all SSR requests are finished in between 100-300ms; However, if your database is huge or your server resources are low, or probably the traffic is extremely high you might want to enable the output cache. The other reason is that you might want to use SSR cache to prevent memory leaks or should I say, hide them ;)

### Protip

#### 1. SSR Cache docs

The SSR cache is [pretty well documented in our docs](/guide/basics/ssr-cache.html). What's important; It works for both: `vue-storefront` and `vue-storefront-api`.

[Read on all the caching mechanisms](https://medium.com/the-vue-storefront-journal/caching-on-production-10b00a5614f8) that Vue Storefront is using.

#### 2. Using Redis tagging

With the SSR Output cache mode enabled, the [`core/server.js`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/e96bc3c0d1ef8239bc2e64c399f1fe924cebed36/core/scripts/server.js#L187) stores the rendered output pages along with http headers into Redis cache. If the page exists in Redis, then it gets served without even starting the Vue SSR Renderer.

Vue Storefront uses Redis in order to use the [`redis-tagging`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redis-tagging) library. Naming and caching are two most ddifficult areas of software development. Cache tagging helps us to deal with cache invalidation.

Vue Storefront tags the output pages with [product](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/e96bc3c0d1ef8239bc2e64c399f1fe924cebed36/core/modules/catalog/helpers/search.ts#L69) and [category](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/e96bc3c0d1ef8239bc2e64c399f1fe924cebed36/core/modules/catalog/store/category/actions.ts#L121) tags. Then all the indexers including: `magento1-vsbridge-indexer`, `mage2vuestorefront` and `magento2-vsbridge-indexer` will invalidate the cache, by specific _product_ or _category_ _ID_. It means the [`invalidate`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/e96bc3c0d1ef8239bc2e64c399f1fe924cebed36/core/scripts/server.js#L156) method will clear out the cache pages tagged with this specific _product id_. 

:::tip NOTE
 This URL requires you to pass the invalidation token set in the [config](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/e96bc3c0d1ef8239bc2e64c399f1fe924cebed36/config/default.json#L12).
:::

You can add any number of the specific cache tags - by just extending the [`availableCacheTags`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/e96bc3c0d1ef8239bc2e64c399f1fe924cebed36/config/default.json#L11) and/or [pushing the tags to `ssrContext`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/e96bc3c0d1ef8239bc2e64c399f1fe924cebed36/core/pages/Home.js#L19) so they can be used by `core/scripts/server`.

This `context` argument passed to `asyncData()` is actually the same context object used by [`core/scripts/server.js`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/e96bc3c0d1ef8239bc2e64c399f1fe924cebed36/core/scripts/server.js#L168), so we're using it as transfer object for passing the tags back and forth between server and Vue.js application.

#### 3. Invalidating SSR cache

:::tip NOTE
With the SSR cache enabled (in the `vue-storefront-api` or `vue-storefront` app) please make sure, you're not using the cache on different layer (for example Varnish or nginx). Otherwise the cache invalidation mechanism won't work. 
:::

The dynamic tags config option: `useOutputCacheTagging` - if set to `true`, Vue Storefront generates the special HTTP Header `X-VS-Cache-Tags`

```js
res.setHeader('X-VS-Cache-Tags', cacheTags);
```

Cache tags are assigned regarding the products and categories that are used on the specific page. A typical `X-VS-Cache-Tags` tag looks like this:

```
X-VS-Cache-Tags: P1852 P198 C20
```

The tags can be used to invalidate the Varnish cache if you use it. [Read more on that](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/api/cache-api/cache-tags-varnish).

:::tip NOTE
 All the official Vue Storefront data indexers including [magento1-vsbridge-indexer](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/magento1-vsbridge-indexer), [magento2-vsbridge-indexer](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/magento2-vsbridge-indexer) and [mage2vuestorefront](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/mage2vuestorefront) support the cache invalidation. 

 If the cache is enabled in both API and Vue Storefront frontend app, please make sure you properly use the `config.server.invalidateCacheForwardUrl` config variable as the indexers can send the cache invalidate request only to one URL (either frontend or backend) and it **should be forwarded** to the other. Please check the default forwarding URLs in the `default.json` and adjust the `key` parameter to the value of `server.invalidateCacheKey`.

## 3. Avoiding prices desynchronization 

Vue Storefront indexers (`magento2-vsbridge-indexer`, `magento1-vsbridge-indexer`, `mage2vuestorefront`) all store the product price (before/after catalog rules applied) into the Elasticsearch. But Elasticsearch can be easily out of sync or the synchronization can be lagged. To avoid the risk of displaying an incorrect price to the customers, Vue Storefront has at least 3 mechanisms - with the `alwaysSyncPlatformPricesOver` on the top.

:::tip NOTE
If you're using the `mage2vuestorefront` for syncing the products please make sure you're syncing the prices **after catalog rules** applied. For this purpose we have special flags to be set on:

```bash
export PRODUCTS_SPECIAL_PRICES=true
export PRODUCTS_RENDER_PRICES=true
node --harmony cli.js products --removeNonExistent=true --partitions=1
```
:::

### Protip

#### 1. _alwaysSyncPlatformPricesOver_

When the `config.products.alwaysSyncPlatformPricesOver` option is on, Vue Storefront will update the visible price on all the listings and product detail pages **directly from source web store, say, Magento**. The code in charge for this operation is located in the [`doPlatformPricesSync`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/48233bfa4575be218a51cccd2474ec358671fc01/core/modules/catalog/helpers/index.ts#L212) helper which is called from the [`tax/calculateTaxes`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/48233bfa4575be218a51cccd2474ec358671fc01/core/modules/catalog/store/tax/actions.ts#L74) action.

:::tip NOTE
This mode works whenever the price is calculated in either server or client's side (`config.tax.calculateServerSide` option).
:::

Check if the way [Vue Storefront syncs the price](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/48233bfa4575be218a51cccd2474ec358671fc01/core/modules/catalog/helpers/index.ts#L216) is exactly what you need, and not [override this action](https://docs.vuestorefront.io/guide/cookbook/module.html#_2-2-recipe-b-override-vuex-store-with-extendstore).

=====================


The `alwaysSyncPlatformPricesOver` mode has two additional options:

1. Clear the prices before sync: `config.products.clearPricesBeforePlatformSync` - when `true`, user won't see the prices cached in Elastic before getting the new prices from Magento
2. Synchronous mode - `config.products.waitForPlatformSync` -  by default the price sync is running in parallel to disyplaing the product or category content. We can make it synchronous (waiting for this process to finish) in order we'd like to have just the current prices from Magento rendered in the HTML markup (SSR; otherwise the prices in SSR will be from Elastic).

More than that - Vue Storefront always get's the **platform totals** (the final prices visible in the shopping cart and the order summary) from Magento/any other backend. There is then no risk we'll see the product at the wrongly set price.


<br />
<br />

## 4. Avoiding stock desynchronization

Pretty much the same case like with the Prices (Tip 3) can occur with the product stocks. By default, all the indexers are setting the [stock information right into the product object](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront-integration-sdk/blob/tutorial/Format-product.md):

 - it's in the main structure of `product.stock`
 - it's set for the `configurable_children` into `product.configurable_children.stock`.

 This information can be outdated.

 Vue Storefront **by default** checks the current stock information when:
 - [**user is adding product to the cart**](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/48233bfa4575be218a51cccd2474ec358671fc01/core/modules/cart/store/actions/itemActions.ts#L53) - this is an async sync (similar one is run when browsing the product variants - you can get info like `0 items available` when switching colors and sizes); `Checkout.js` is waiting for all the results from the [`stock/queueCheck`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/48233bfa4575be218a51cccd2474ec358671fc01/core/pages/Checkout.js#L69) calls,
 - when the **cart is synced** with the server - eCommerce backend [checks the product availability once again](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/48233bfa4575be218a51cccd2474ec358671fc01/core/modules/cart/store/actions/mergeActions.ts#L45) and [notify user](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/48233bfa4575be218a51cccd2474ec358671fc01/core/modules/cart/components/AddToCart.ts#L31) if the product can't be added to the cart or restores previous quantity (if changed),
 - when the `filterOutUnavailableVariants` mode is on and the user a) enters the product page, b) browses the category pages.

 The `config.products.filterOutUnavailableVariants` mode is pretty interesting thing because only by having this mode switched on you can be sure we're **not displaying unavailable variants**. When it's true Vue Storefront is taking the Stock information out of Magento and updates the `product.stock` info for the whole product list + product page (current product). Then it removes all the `configurable_children` that are not avaialable. [See the detailed implementation](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/48233bfa4575be218a51cccd2474ec358671fc01/core/modules/catalog/helpers/index.ts#L121).

There are two additional settings for this mode on:
 - `config.prodducts.configurableChildrenStockPrefetchStatic` - when this is true, Vue Storefront is prefetching the stock info for the statically set number of product, it can be configured by `config.products.configurableChildrenStockPrefetchStaticPrefetchCount`,
 - `config.prodducts.configurableChildrenStockPrefetchDynamic` - when this is set to true, Vue Storefront is prefetching the stock info for any visible product; it's done in the [`ProductTile.vue](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/48233bfa4575be218a51cccd2474ec358671fc01/src/themes/default/components/core/ProductTile.vue#L108) - make sure your theme is supporting this.
    
We've got the limited support for Magento MSI in the default implementation. [Make sure you've got it enabled when on Magento 2.3.x](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront-api/pull/226).

**Note:** This feature might then be used for the **Donut caching** strategies (related to Tip 2 - SSR cache).

**Note:** If you need to avoid Magento stock calls there is a way by getting the data with the same format as `https://vue-storefront-api/api/stock/list` is returning but from Elastic. It should be a drop-in replacement - I [mean changing the `stock.endpoint`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/bb9044d6aaa36d4881733876f4646fabe7b6e102/config/default.json#L368) to this new one. Et viola: you avoid asking Magento, still having this 'cache punch holing' with `config.products.filterOutUnavailableVariants` mode on

There is a ready made endpoint for getting stock from Elastic (not from Magento) [is here #PR330](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront-api/pull/330).

**Troubleshooting:** If the non-existing variants won't disappear that means some frontend work on your side needs to be done. I mean - with this `filterOutUnavailableVariants` setting, we're pulling the current stock info to `product.stock` and `product.configurable_children.stock` properties. By those properties updated we're then removing the out-of-stock `configurable_children`.
If the variants arer still available then [take a look at this line](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/48233bfa4575be218a51cccd2474ec358671fc01/core/modules/catalog/store/product/actions.ts#L629) and there should be a change made like:

from:

```js
        if (isServer) {
          subloaders.push(context.dispatch('setupBreadcrumbs', { product: product }))
          subloaders.push(context.dispatch('filterUnavailableVariants', { product: product }))
        } else {
          attributesPromise.then(() => context.dispatch('setupBreadcrumbs', { product: product })) // if this is client's side request postpone breadcrumbs setup till attributes are loaded to avoid too-early breadcrumb switch #2469
          context.dispatch('filterUnavailableVariants', { product: product }) // exec async
        }
```
to:

```js
          subloaders.push(context.dispatch('filterUnavailableVariants', { product: product }))
        if (isServer) {
          subloaders.push(context.dispatch('setupBreadcrumbs', { product: product }))
        } else {
          attributesPromise.then(() => context.dispatch('setupBreadcrumbs', { product: product })) // if this is client's side request postpone breadcrumbs setup till attributes are loaded to avoid too-early breadcrumb switch #2469
        }
```

Just in order to make sure that attribute filtering always takes place before rendering the PDP.

## 5. How Vue Storefront calculates prices and taxes

Vue Storefront has two modes of calculating the product prices:
- Client side (when `config.tax.calculateServerSide` is set to `false`) - that can be usefull in case the tax should be recalculated based on the address change,
- Server side (when `config.tax.calculateServerSide` is set to `true`) - which is our default mode.

Depending on the mode, taxes are calulated by [`taxCalc.ts` client side](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/5f2b5cd6a8496a60884c091e8509d3b58b7a0358/core/modules/catalog/helpers/taxCalc.ts#L74) or [`taxcalc.js` server side](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront-api/blob/d3d0e7892cd063bbd69e545f3f2b6fdd9843d524/src/lib/taxcalc.js#L251-L253). 

You may see that both these files are applying **exactly** the same logic.

In order to calculate the prices and taxes we need first toget the proper tax rate. It's based on [`taxrate`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront-integration-sdk#taxrate-entity) entity, stored in the Elastic. Each product can have the property [`product.tax_class_id`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/5f2b5cd6a8496a60884c091e8509d3b58b7a0358/core/modules/catalog/helpers/taxCalc.ts#L213) set. Depending on it's value Vue Storefront is applying the `taxrate`, it's also applying the [country and region to the filter](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/5f2b5cd6a8496a60884c091e8509d3b58b7a0358/core/modules/catalog/helpers/taxCalc.ts#L226). 

**Note:** We're currently not supporting searching the tax rules by `customer_tax_class_id` neither by the `tax_postcode` fields of `taxrate` entity. Pull requests more than welcome ;)

After getting the right tax rate we can calculate the prices.

We've got the following price fields priority in the VS:
- `final_price` - if set, depending on the `config.tax.finalPriceIncludesTax` - it's taken as final price or Net final price,
- `special_price` - if it's set and it's lower than `price` it will replace the `price` and the `price` value will be set into `original_price` property,
- `price` - if set, dedending on the `config.tax.sourcePriceIncludesTax` - it's taken as final price or Net final price.

Depending on the `config.tax.finalPriceIncludesTax` and `config.tax.sourcePriceIncludesTax` settings Vue Storefront calculates the prices and stores them into following fields.

Product Special price:
- `special_price` - optional, if set - it's always Net price,
- `special_price_incl_tax` - optional, if set - it's always price after taxes,
- `special_price_tax` - optional, if set it's the tax amount.

Product Regular price:
- `price` - required, if set - it's always Net price,
- `price_incl_tax` - required, if set - it's always price after taxes,
- `price_tax` - required, if set it's the tax amount,

Product Final price:
- `final_price` - optional, if set - it's always Net price,
- `final_price_incl_tax` - optional, if set - it's always price after taxes,
- `final_price_tax` - optional, if set it's the tax amount,

Product Original price (set only if `final_price` or `special_price` are lower than `price`):
- `original_price` - optional, if set - it's always Net price,
- `original_price_incl_tax` - optional, if set - it's always price after taxes,
- `original_price_tax` - optional, if set it's the tax amount.

**Note:** The prices are being set for all `configurable_children` with the exact same format
**Note:** If any of the `configurable_children` has the price lower than the main product, the main product price will be updated accordingly.

## 6. Limiting SSR HTML size a.k.a. INITIAL_STATE optimization


One of the key side-effects of the [Server Side Rendering](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/ssr.html) is the need to provide the initial Vuex state right to the browser just before the page will be hydrated. 

Hydration means - Vue.js is matching the statically generated HTML markup with virtually generated (CSR) Vue.js component tree. **Only after this process site becomes interactive**. Even slightly different markup might cause SSR hydration errors. Therefore, Vue.js is requiring us to [output the `window.__INITIAL_STATE__`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/8f3ce717a823ef3a5c7469082b8a8bcb36abb5c1/core/client-entry.ts#L29) which is then used to **replace** the Vuex initial state. Then, the [app is being hydrated](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/develop/core/client-entry.ts#L111) by `app.mount()` call.

The only problem is, that the `__INITIAL_STATE__` can be really huuuuuuuge. On category pages, including a lot of product listings it can be in megabytes!
Vue Storefront provides you with few mechanisms to control the initial state.

1. Vue Storefront provides you a mechanism to control the `__INITIAL_STATE__` [based on the `config.ssr.initialStateFilter`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/8f3ce717a823ef3a5c7469082b8a8bcb36abb5c1/core/scripts/utils/ssr-renderer.js#L40) fields list. So you can remove the fields from `__INITIAL_STATE__` - even using the `.` notation. So you can put `attribute` on the list to remove the whole state for `attribute` Vuex module OR you can specify `attribte.list_by_code` to remove just that. By using this mechanism, you can process much more data in the SSR than are send to the browser (see point no. 2 which is just about opposite approach to limit the set of processed information).

2. You might also want to use the [`config.entities.*.includeFields`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/8f3ce717a823ef3a5c7469082b8a8bcb36abb5c1/config/default.json#L170) filter. These lists of fields are set to limit the number of fields [loaded from Elastic](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/8f3ce717a823ef3a5c7469082b8a8bcb36abb5c1/core/lib/search.ts#L31). If you add any new field to your entity though, please make sure you also included it in the `includeFields` list.

By using any of those mechanisms you must be fully aware of the **hydration damage** they might cause. In order to prevent any hydration issues, you might use [`lazy-hydrate`](https://github.com/maoberlehner/vue-lazy-hydration) that will let you control the hydration flow for specific parts (components) on the page. Especially the [manual hydration](https://github.com/maoberlehner/vue-lazy-hydration#manually-trigger-hydration) can be usefull.

The general rule of thumb is that **when you remove anything from the intial state** then you shoud:
- load this data ASAP in the client side (eg. in `beforeMount`),
- hydrate the component **only after** the data was loaded.

See how we did it for [`Category.vue`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/ab27bfbd8abef5f1d37666a38fa0387f50ba6eca/src/themes/default/pages/Category.vue#L70) - where the hydration is being manually triggered by the [`loading`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/ab27bfbd8abef5f1d37666a38fa0387f50ba6eca/src/themes/default/pages/Category.vue#L70) flag.

**Note:** Please make sure if you're loading your category tree dynamically - as the category trees can be truly heavy with all these subcategories included. By default Vue Storefront offers this [dynamic category prefetching from v1.7](https://docs.vuestorefront.io/guide/basics/configuration.html#dynamic-categories-prefetching).

You can save up to 30-40% of the page size which positively improve the Lighthouse/Pagespeed scores. However not always improves the User Experience - as the lazy hydration typically requires you to fetch the required data by another network call (which can be skipped by the initial state mechanism).

Of course, in the end please make sure that you compress (gzip + minify) the SSR output - probably on [nginx level](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-increase-pagespeed-score-by-changing-your-nginx-configuration-on-ubuntu-16-04) or using the [compression](https://www.npmjs.com/package/compression) and/or [minify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-minify) middleware added to the [`core/scripts/server.js`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/8f3ce717a823ef3a5c7469082b8a8bcb36abb5c1/core/scripts/server.js#L116)

## 7. Url Dispatcher explained 

Starting with Vue Storefront 1.9 we're supporting [custom url structure](https://docs.vuestorefront.io/guide/basics/url.html). `UrlDispatcher` is enabled by the [`config.seo.useUrlDispatcher`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/3e4191e5e4b1bfc5b349f5d7cff919c695168125/config/default.json#L29). 

The business logick of the dispatcher was implemented as a [Vue router guard](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/navigation-guards.html) - [`beforeEach`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/3e4191e5e4b1bfc5b349f5d7cff919c695168125/core/modules/url/router/beforeEach.ts#L41).

The dispatcher is first runing the [`url/mapUrl`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/3e4191e5e4b1bfc5b349f5d7cff919c695168125/core/modules/url/store/actions.ts#L42). This action is first checking the `state.dispatcherMap` for the previously registered URL mapping. If no mapping is set then dispatcher is checking the [`localStorage` cache](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/3e4191e5e4b1bfc5b349f5d7cff919c695168125/core/modules/url/store/actions.ts#L51) and only after that the `mappingFallback` action is being called.

It's the place where the true mapping is taking place. By default, Vue Storefront first checks the URL against Elastic, `product` entities - using the `url_path` as a filter. If it's not found (statistically products are 10xmore frequently browsed by URL than categories because of their count), then the request to `category` collection is being made.

Once the route was mapped it's [registered](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/3e4191e5e4b1bfc5b349f5d7cff919c695168125/core/modules/url/store/actions.ts#L56) in the `dispatcherMap` in order to not execute the additional network request in the future.

The optimization hack is that [`category-next/loadCategoryProducts`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/3e4191e5e4b1bfc5b349f5d7cff919c695168125/core/modules/catalog-next/store/category/actions.ts#L100) already registers the mapping - so clicking the product from the category list doesn't require any network call to get the proper route data.

As you might seen the `url/mapUrl` returns the data in a very similar format to routes collection used by vue-router. **It's not the real route though**. It's being converted to `Route` object by the `processDynamicRoute` helper before being processed by the router itself. To avoid any user redirections we're using the `RouterManager` to [add this route to the `vue-router` routing table](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/3e4191e5e4b1bfc5b349f5d7cff919c695168125/core/modules/url/router/beforeEach.ts#L43) and forward the user to this new, exact match route in order to render the proper page.

This mechanism is pretty flexible as you may add the dynamic routes on the fly. There is even a [community module](https://github.com/kodbruket/vsf-mapping-fallback) letting you map the url routes programmatically.

**Note:** The [`processDynamicRoute`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/3e4191e5e4b1bfc5b349f5d7cff919c695168125/core/modules/url/helpers/index.ts#L26) does convert the `routeData` from `url/mapUrl` to **real** vue `Route` object. It works like it's searching thru all the routes registered by `theme` and `modules`. Example:

If your route data is (`routeData`):

```js
{
  name: 'configurable-product',
  params: {
    slug: product.slug,
    parentSku: product.sku,
    childSku: params['childSku'] ? params['childSku'] : product.sku
}
```

and your `theme/router/index.js` consists the following definition: (`userRoute`)

```js
  { name: 'configurable-product', path: '/p/:parentSku/:slug/:childSku', component: Product }
```

then `processDynamicRoute` helper will return the `Route` object created by merging the `userRoute` with `routeData`

```js
  Object.assign({}, userRoute, routeData, { path: '/' + fullRootPath, name: `urldispatcher-${fullRootPath}` })
```

`fullRootPath` is the url processed by the dispatcher. This new, virtual route is being added to the vue-router routing table and the user is being forwarded to it. So you may see that `url` module can be switched on/off easily as it's using the on-top mechanism over the existing vue-router - mapping the virtual urls to existing theme or module routes.

**Note:** In order to have it up and running please make sure your `products` and `categories` do have the `url_path` properly set and unique.

## 8. Multistore configuration explained

You can read about the [basic Multistore configuration in the official docs](https://docs.vuestorefront.io/guide/integrations/multistore.html#changing-the-ui-for-specific-store-views). Vue Storefront supports multistore based on the `StoreView` level. 

`StoreView` is a configuration context object, set by the Vue Storefront per each request - accesible via [`currentStoreView()](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/9dca392a832ba45e9b1c3589eb84f51fbc2e8d6e/core/lib/multistore.ts#L33) helper from [`multistore.ts`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/develop/core/lib/multistore.ts).

One `StoreView` is generally speaking a combination of Language + Currency.

Example: If you have a store per country, that supports two languages (eg. Switzerland supporting EURO currency and both French + German languages) you'll probably end up with pair of two `StoreViews`: (EUR; DE) + (EUR; FR). Each `StoreView` has it's own unique name that is being used to differentiate and switch the sites.

Vue Storefront `StoreViews` allows you to differentiate all the basic settings per specific site. [See the config](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/af640f3aa0372308db534786fea587b24e8e87d3/config/default.json#L91):

```json

      "multistore": false,
      "commonCache": true,
      "mapStoreUrlsFor": ["de", "it"],

        },
        "tax": {
          "sourcePriceIncludesTax": false,

        }
      },
      "it": {

        },

          "sourcePriceIncludesTax": false,
          "defaultCountry": "IT",
          "defaultRegion": "",

        },
        "i18n": {
          "fullCountryName": "Italy",
          "fullLanguageName": "Italian",
          "defaultCountry": "IT",

          "defaultLocale": "it-IT",
          "currencyCode": "EUR",
          "currencySign": "EUR",
          "dateFormat": "HH:mm D-M-YYYY"
        }
      }
    }
  ```

### Create the individual indexes per each specific `StoreView`

First of all - we're having separate Elastic search configs per each storeView. This means you can have `product`, `categories` and `attributes` text attributes translated and storead - each in the separate Elastic search indexes.

Our [default indexer](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/mage2vuestorefront#multistore-setup) and the [magento2-vsbridge-indexer](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/magento2-vsbridge-indexer) both support the multistore indexing.

### Setup the `storeViews` section in the `config/local.json` 

Each storeView must has the unique `code` (`it` and `de` in the example above) set + elasticsearch section pointing to the right index.

**Note:** Remember to populate the same configuration [within the `vue-storefront-api` config file](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront-api/blob/b4198929ef435e20162a192ea2a02cb25e552d45/config/default.json#L50). Please make sure that the `config.availableStores` collection contains all the `storeCodes` you'll be passing to the API as well.

**Note:** The multistore business logick is being applied only when the `config.storeViews.multistore` is set to `true` (the default value is: `false`).

 The `storeCode` parameter [will be appended as a query parameter (`?storeCode`)](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/9dca392a832ba45e9b1c3589eb84f51fbc2e8d6e/core/lib/multistore.ts#L105) to all `vue-storefront-api` requests that will let API know which backend API endpoints to query. By default - with Magento2 [we're adding the proper `storeCode` to the API request calls](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront-api/blob/b4198929ef435e20162a192ea2a02cb25e552d45/src/platform/magento2/util.js#L7). However you can even [differentiate the base url or Magento2 API credentials if you like](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront-api/blob/b4198929ef435e20162a192ea2a02cb25e552d45/src/platform/magento2/util.js#L20). 

 ### Vue Storefront `storeCode` resolver

 Vue Storefront is setting `currentStoreView` value as one of the first things processing the request. It's being done in the [`app.ts:createStore`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/af640f3aa0372308db534786fea587b24e8e87d3/core/app.ts#L73) function. The `storeCode` is retrived from the [server context](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/af640f3aa0372308db534786fea587b24e8e87d3/core/server-entry.ts#L63) or [from the current route](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/af640f3aa0372308db534786fea587b24e8e87d3/core/server-entry.ts#L67).

 The [`storeCodeFromRoute`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/develop/core/lib/storeCodeFromRoute.ts) helper is supporting two ways of obtaining the current store code:

 1) from the url path: https://test.storefrontcloud.io/de vs. https://test.storefrontcloud.io/it
 2) from the [url domain name and path](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/9dca392a832ba45e9b1c3589eb84f51fbc2e8d6e/core/lib/storeCodeFromRoute.ts#L30); this way lets you run Vue Storefront multistore on multiple domains.

 **Note:** You can pass the `storeCode` via server context as well. Server context is set by the [`core/scripts/server.ts`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/9dca392a832ba45e9b1c3589eb84f51fbc2e8d6e/core/scripts/utils/ssr-renderer.js#L110) - and it's sourced from `ENV.STORE_CODE` or if you're using a HTTP Proxy (like nginx) - from the request header of `x-vs-store-code`. This way you can differentiate store view instances by many different ways and not only by the domain/url.

 ### Routing

 Vue Storefront is adding all the routes to the routing table using [current `storeView` code prefix](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/9dca392a832ba45e9b1c3589eb84f51fbc2e8d6e/src/themes/default/index.js#L31). If your [theme/router/index.js](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/develop/src/themes/default/router/index.js) has the following routes defined, and the `currentStoreVioew().storeCode === 'de'`

 ```js
 let routes = [
  { name: 'checkout', path: '/checkout', component: Checkout },
  { name: 'legal', path: '/legal', component: Static, props: {page: 'lorem', title: 'Legal Notice'}, meta: {title: 'Legal Notice', description: 'Legal Notice - example of description usage'} },
  { name: 'privacy', path: '/privacy', component: Static, props: {page: 'lorem', title: 'Privacy'} },
 ```

Then the [`setupMultistoreRoutes`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/9dca392a832ba45e9b1c3589eb84f51fbc2e8d6e/core/lib/multistore.ts#L172) helper will add these routes to `vue-router` as:

```js
 let routes = [
  { name: 'checkout', path: '/de/checkout', component: Checkout },
  { name: 'legal', path: '/de/legal', component: Static, props: {page: 'lorem', title: 'Legal Notice'}, meta: {title: 'Legal Notice', description: 'Legal Notice - example of description usage'} },
  { name: 'privacy', path: '/de/privacy', component: Static, props: {page: 'lorem', title: 'Privacy'} },
```

The business logic of modifying the route configs is embeded in the [`localizedRouteConfig`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/9dca392a832ba45e9b1c3589eb84f51fbc2e8d6e/core/lib/multistore.ts#L189) helper.

**Note:** When you're using the `storeCode` resolver, based on `domain + path` schema then you should set the `config.storeViews.*.appendStoreCode` to `false`. This option prevents `localizedRouteConfig` helper from adding the `storeCode` as a path so the store views can be differentiated based on the `currentStoreView().url` instead - which supports `domain + path`.

**Note:** Please make sure you're creating the links within your theme using the same `localizedRoute` helper. This helper supports string URLs:

```html
<router-link :to="localizedRoute(page.link)" class="cl-accent relative">{{
  page.title
}}</router-link>
```

or route objects:

```html
<router-link
  :to="
    localizedRoute({
      name: product.type_id + '-product',
      params: {
        parentSku: product.parentSku ? product.parentSku : product.sku,
        slug: product.slug,
        childSku: product.sku,
      },
    })
  "
></router-link>
```

**Note:** The `UrlDispatcher` feature - available from Vue Storefront 1.9 supports the multistore routes as well. The `url_path` field passed to [`url/mapUrl`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/9dca392a832ba45e9b1c3589eb84f51fbc2e8d6e/core/modules/url/store/actions.ts#L46) action takes the full url - including `storeCode` as an entry parameter. You might want to use [vsf-mapping-fallback](https://github.com/kodbruket/vsf-mapping-fallback) for some overrides.

 ### Customizing the theme, per store view

 You can run all the `StoreViews` within one, single Vue Storefront instance. It's the default mode. The `StoreViews` are then selected based on the url/path/incoming request headers or env. variables. As simple as it is this mode won't let you apply totally different themes for each individual `StoreView`. It's because the theme files are bundled withing `app.js` bundle provided to the client. Having all themes bundled in will generate a really huge JS bundle and slow down the page in the end.

 You can still customize some UI elements per `storeView` using conditional `v-if` logic and loading specific components within single theme.
 
 **Note:** You can also override some root-level components (like `pages/Category.vue`) by modifying the `theme/router/index.js` routing schema by adding the specific store-view based urls directly in the routing table.

If you really need to use different themes per each individual `storeView` then the best way would be to deploy and execute separate Vue Storefront node instances per each store view (eg. `de` running on port 3000, `it` on 3001 etc); then - make sure your proxy service is routing the request to the proper instance. The instances can have different configs, including different `config.theme` parameter.

Your `nginx` config for this scheme will be something like this:

``` 
ProxyPass / http://localhost:3000/
ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:3000/

ProxyPass /de http://localhost:3001/de
ProxyPassReverse /de http://localhost:3001/de

ProxyPass /it http://localhost:3002/it
ProxyPassReverse /it http://localhost:3002/it
```
