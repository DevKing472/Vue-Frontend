## 0. Introduction

_VueStorefront_ is getting tremendous attention from the market and gain traction from developers with more than 20 sites running on production. In the mean time, _VueStorefront_ framework evolves with each new release and the docs can hardly catch up with it! 

These training materials are a set of chief-recipes, experiences learned from the trenches. Iâ€™m trying to answer how to run _VueStorefront_ on production, troubleshoot most of the common problems and explain all the hidden features of _VueStorefront_ that can help you scale the application and solve most common issues.

Some topics here were taken from [frequently asked questions in our Forum](https://forum.vuestorefront.io/c/help). Some [came from Slack](http://slack.vuestorefront.io). Some came from core-consulting and our own works. One thing in common; each and every recipe is super-crucial for stable _VueStorefront_ run on production and they all cause some serious results when executed carelessly.
