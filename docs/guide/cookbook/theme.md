## 0. Introduction
Theme is what customers get first impression from your shop. You will be majorly discouraged if your customers underestimate your shop by looks and feels of the first impression due to poorly designed theme when you had pearls and golds in value for your customers on your shop. Great products, meticulously calibrated technology backing your store, are abysmally depreciated which impact your sales in result. We are here to help you get away with such disasters by guiding you in wrapping your head around how to deal with `theme` in _Vue Storefront_ context. Are you ready? a _Picaso_?


## 1. How `default` theme works
_Theme_ is the face of your store. Face is what makes people recognize you as you. That works just the same for your store. However, your _theme_ shows not only looks and feels of your store's identity, but also represents how features such as _UI_, _widgets_ and _components_ are arranged and interconnected just the same as your face helps connect _eyes_, _nose_, _ears_ and _brain_ under the skin.

Online stores should demand many features in common and they deal with similar types of requests from their customers to fulfill their desire : _Purchase_. They are divided and placed under the `core` folder to be dealt with.

We already got our hands dirty to place all the core business logic in place and created the `default` theme as the best practice to show how they are intertwined behind the scene and make it work seamlessly out of the box. 

In this recipe, we will walk through how `default` theme works in cooperation with other core parts of the `app` such as `modules`, `filters`, `stores` and so on.
