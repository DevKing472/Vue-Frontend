## 0. Introduction
Modular approach to a system is often considered an implementation of the traditional engineering concept [*High cohesion with low coupling*](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14000762/what-does-low-in-coupling-and-high-in-cohesion-mean). By this we mean, one may ***extend*** a logic of others without breaking a flow of the original. **Vue Storefront** also employs the concept in order to secure 3rd party developers' happiness. This chapter opens up the belly of new **Vue Storefront** module structure for you as of *1.11* release.

## 1. How to bootstrap a module
When you want to tweak any open source for whatever reason needed to make it more fantastic, first thing you need to look for is *modules* within the code base. You may name *API*, *hooks* or *observers* for that matter, but *module* basically represents all of them in one place in its design.  

If the open source author is serious about his offspring, one must admit it's impossible to take care of all the details to all the use cases out in the wild. So one should expose joint point of core parts so that 3rd party developers may inject their required logic into it. Now, jungles conquered.
