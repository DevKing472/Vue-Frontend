# Introduction to Vue Storefront
Vue Storefront is rather a complex solution with a lot of possibilities. Learning all of them can take some time. In this introduction we will learn all it's crucial concepts in a few minutes which are enough enough to start playing with Vue Storefront right after reading it,

## What is Vue Storefront
Vue Storefront is a headless and backend-agnostic eCommerce Progressive Web App written in Vue.js. The fact that it's using headless architecture allows Vue Storefront to be connected with any eCommerce platform so it can be a frontend PWA for Magento, Shopify, BigCommerce, WooCommerce etc.

Key features of Vue Storefront are:
- being platform-agnostic
- focus on performance
- mobile-first approach
- cutting-edge tech
- no limitations in theming and customization
- being Open Source with MIT licence
- lot of focus on developer experience
- out of the box Server Side Rendering (for SEO)
- offline mode

## How it connects with backend platforms?
Vue Storefront manages to be platform agnostic thanks to the [vue-storefront-api](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront-api) and dedicated API connectors for eCommerce backend platforms. The data format in vue-storefront-api is always the same for any platform which means no matter which eCommerce backend you'll use your frontend remains without changes.

It's a great strategy for migrations since you can easly migrate from one platform to another (or it's other version like magento 1 -> 2) without touching your frontend.

The API connector works in two phases:
- **data pump** (on the image mage2nosql) is pulling static data (catalog, orders etc) from your eCommerce platform to Vue Storefront ElasticSearch and changes it's format to the one consumed by vue-storefront-api. After pulling the data you can display product catalog in Vue Storefront. After pumping the data into ElasticSearch it will stay in sync with changes on backend platform side and update it's content.
- **worker pool** is a synchronization of so called dynamic calls (user sessions, cart rules etc) that can't be stored in the database and needs to be called by vue-storefront-api directly from the backend platform.

While managing this two phases of integration Vue Storefront can work with your backend platform. 

Some of the backend platforms already have their integrations (Magento 2, Magento 1, CoreShop, BigCommerce, WooCommerce) but you can easily make your own with [integration boilerplate](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/bigcommerce2vuestorefront
).

The blue parts on the diagram are responsible for offline cache and will be explained later in the article.

## How it works?

There are 3 concepts you need to be familiar with while working with Vue Storefront.
- **Vue Storefront Core** ( `core` folder) is the glue for all it's features that allows Vue Storefront to work. It contains all the entry points, SSR behaviour, build process, in-app libs and helpers. You shouldn't touch this folder directly when building your own implementations to receive updates.
- **Vue Storefront Modules** ( `core/modules` and `src/modules` ) are the eCommerce features. Each module is one encapsulated feature (like cart, wishlist, catalog, some 3rd party integration). You can add/remove/edit this modules as you will and compose your Vue Storefront shop only with features that you need. They are also used for 3rd party extensions
- **Vue Storefront Themes** ( `src/themes` ) are the actual shop implementations. In themes you can use and extend all the logic from registered modules / core and add your HTML markup and styles. Vue Storefront is providing a fully customizable default theme.

To summarize: Your shop is basically a Vue storefront theme that uses features provided by modules. Vue Storefront core glues it all together

Knowing this three concepts allows you to confidentially work with Vue Storefront and make your own shops.

## Installing Vue Storefront
When you want to play with Vue Storefront there are 3 options:
- you can set up the frontend connected to our demo backend platform (best to try out the Vue Storefront)
- you can set up frontend with your own `vue-storefront-api` and database dumped from demo
- you can set up frontend with `vue-storefront-api` connected to your eCommerce backend

To do any of this simply type `yarn installer` in the root of the project and answer the questions in the console. Once the installation is done type yarn dev to run your project (by default of port 3000). No matter what option you choose you can change the settings in config file later.

## Vue Storefront config file
Most of the Vue Storefront configuration (like active theme, backend API addresses, multistore setup etc) is done through it's config file that can be found under `config` folder. The `default.json` file contains all the default setup. 

For your own implementation you should create a `local.json` file in the same directry and include fields from `default.json` that you want to override. This two files will be merged in favour of `local.json` during a build process. If you will use installer to set up your Vue Storefront instance it'll generate proper config files.

## Building themes in Vue Storefront

While making themes in Vue Storefront in most cases all you need to take care of is creating your own HTML and CSS markup. All required business logic is exposed by core with it's core modules and can be easly injected into any of theme components.
The mechanism of injecting core business logic into themes is very simple. We are using Vue.js mixins to keep upgradable business logic in the core. 

Business logic from core component can be easly injected into any theme component as a Vue.js mixin. We can easly inject it into any of our theme components just my importing it and adding as a mixin ( eg `mixins: [Microcart]` is what you need to use core Microcart logic). This is all you need to make use of core business logic inside your theme. With this approach we can easly ship updates to all core components without breaking your shop.

The easiest way to create your own theme is to create a copy of the default one, change it's name in it's `package.json` file, change active theme in `config/local.jso`n and run `yarn` to make lerna linking (which we are using for monorepos).

## Offline mode and cache

Vue Storefront is still working even while user is offline. 

We managed to do this by making heavy use of the browser cache. 
For the static assets (only prod) we are using sw-precache plugin (config can be found in `core/build/webpack.prod.sw.config.js` ). They are cached in Service Worker and can be inspected under `Application/Cache Storage` tab of your Developer Tools.

:::warning
Please mind that Service Worker is working only on production mode.

For the catalog and store data cache we are using IndexedDB and Local Storage. We are also prefetching products from visited categories so once you enter one all of it's products are available offline. The mechanism of offline storage is located under core/lin./storage.

We are using some of cached data even while user is online to display the content instantly. This is why Vue Storefront is so fast.
