# Project Structure

When you use a storefront, you are a given a monorepo that contains two applications:

1. **Server Middleware** - A Node.js application that handles communication with the different services you use
2. **Web Application** - A Next.js or Nuxt.js application that handles the UI of your storefront

You'll also start with a set of layouts, pages, and components. These are built with [Storefront UI](https://docs.storefrontui.io) and are ready to be customized to fit your needs.

Our storefronts and boilerplates come with a pre-defined project structure that is designed to help you get started quickly. While this project structure may have minor changes between each storefront, the general structure will remain the same.

## `apps/`

The apps folder contains the two applications that make up your storefront. When you run the `dev` command from the project's root, Turborepo will run both of these applications concurrently - meaning that you can work on both the server and web application at the same time.

### `server/`

A [Vue Storefront Middleware](/middleware) application that handles communication with your integration. The exact configuration will vary in each storefront, but can be edited inside the `middleware.config` file

### `web/`

The frontend application for your storefront, pre-built with either [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.ocm) or [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). This is where you will build your UI and add any additional logic that you need.
