# Vue Storefront API

Vue Storefront is powered by vue-storefront-api data middleware. It's a REST service which unifies all the differences between eCommerce platforms under one, platform agnostic API. Please find more details about the project [on Github](http://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront-api).

All methods accept and respond with `application/json` content type.

## Cart module

Cart module is in charge of creating the eCommerce backend shopping carts and synchronizing the items users have in Vue Storefront and eCommerce backend. For example it can synchronize Vue Storefront shopping cart with the Magento quotes.

## POST [/api/cart/create]()

WHEN:

This method is called when new Vue Storefront shopping cart is created. First visit, page refresh, after user-authorization ... If the `token` GET parameter is provided it's called as logged-in user; if not - it's called as guest-user. To draw the difference - let's keep to Magento example. For guest user vue-storefront-api is subsequently operating on `/guest-carts` API endpoints and for authorized users on `/carts/` endpoints)

GET PARAMS:
`token` - null OR user token returned from [`/api/user/login`](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront-api/blob/7d98771994b1009ad17d69c458f9e93686cfb145/src/api/user.js#L48)

```
{
    "code": 200,
    "result": "a17b9b5fb9f56652b8280bb94c52cd93"
}
```

The `result` is a guest-cart id that should be used for all subsequent cart related operations as `?cartId=a17b9b5fb9f56652b8280bb94c52cd93`

For authorized user

`curl 'https://demo.vuestorefront.io/api/cart/create?token=xu8h02nd66yq0gaayj4x3kpqwity02or' -X POST`

```
{
    "code":200,
