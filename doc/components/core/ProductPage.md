### Methods
#### Unbound methods
`filterChanged (filterOption)` - sets attributes on the product according to what the user has chosen on the page. Dispatches *'product/configure'* action. *This method is called when 'filter-changed-product' event is triggered, but it's not triggered anywhere in the code.*  
**Parameters**  
*filterOption* - an object that represents an attribute that have changed on the product.

`fetchData (store, route)` - fetches current product data from the backend by dispatching *'product/single'* action. Also dispatches several other actions to get breadcrumbs, product attributes, variants for configurable product, also to set subproducts if the product is grouped.  
**Parameters**  
*store* - Vuex store  
*route* - global router object  

`loadData ({ store, route })` - dispatches *'product/reset'* action that sets current product to original product, nullifies all the configuration and options, then calls *fetchData* method to load current product data.  
**Parameters**
*{store, route}* - an object that consists of references to Vuex store and global router object.  

`stateCheck` - if current product has a parent, redirects to parent product's page. Then checks if the current product is in the wishlist or in the compare list, sets *favorite* and *compare* props accordingly.  
**Parameters**  
No parameters  

#### Bound methods
`validateRoute` - this method is called whenever the global *$route* object changes its value. Calls *loadData* and *stateCheck* methods.    
**Parameters**  
No Parameters  

`addToList` - adds the current product to the compare by dispatching *'compare/addItem'* actions accordingly.
**Parameters**
*list* - compare

`removeFromList` - remove the current product from the compare by dispatching *'compare/removeItem'* actions accordingly.
**Parameters**
*list* - compare

### Hooks
#### asyncData
Since the app is using SSR, this method prefetches and resolves the asyncronous data before rendering happens and saves it to Vuex store. On Product page this is done by calling *loadData* method.  

The `asyncData` fires the `product-after-load` event which can be used to populate the Vuex SSR store for additional data regarding the product.

#### beforeMount
Calls *stateCheck* method. Defines *'product-after-priceupdate'* event listener which, if triggered, dispatches *'product/setCurrent'* action that sets current product object in Vuex store. Also defines *'filter-changed-product'* event listener which, if triggered, calls *filterChanged* method. *Currently 'filter-changed-product' event is not triggered anywhere.*
#### beforeDestroy
Removes event listeners that were defined in *beforeMount* hook.
