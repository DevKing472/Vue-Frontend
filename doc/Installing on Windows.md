# Introduction

Vue storefront is based on open source technologies which SHOULD (in theory ;)) works perfectly well on most of the leading operating systems. However, we're developing the project using MacOS and Linux machines.

## Prerequsites 
1. Please download [Docker for Windows](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows) and install it on your machine
2. It can be usefull to have [Ubuntu for Windows enabled](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide) for your convienence (cmd line tools, scripting used in the project uses bash) 
3. Install newest version of Node.js on Ubuntu Bash for Windows:
```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```
4. You can use any editor for development BUT we're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which is cool, free and very JS friendly!
