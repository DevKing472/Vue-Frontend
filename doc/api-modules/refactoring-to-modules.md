# Vue Storefront refactoring plan for modules

For now we are just detaching the features from core components (see cart module as an example) **we are not moving components, stores etc to api modules folder yet**. Please keep it in mind. After we will move all the features then we will proceed with components and stores.

[under construction, i'll write details soon[
