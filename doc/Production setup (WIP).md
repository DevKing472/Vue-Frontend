## Introduction

If You like to start developing sites using Vue Storefront, probably You need to start with the [Installation guide](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/master/doc/Installing%20on%20Linux%20and%20MacOS.md). For the development purposes You'll probably be using `yarn install` / `npm run installer` sequence which will setup Vue Storefront locally using the automated installer and prepared Docker images for having Elastic Search and Redis support.

Development mode means You're using node.js based server as HTTP service and running the app on the `3000` TCP port. As it's great for local testing it's **not recommended** to use installer and direct user access to node.js in production configurations.

## Production setup - bare VPS

To run Vue Storefront in the production mode without Docker/Kubernetes You'll need the Virtual Private Server with `root` access (for the setup purposes). We'll assume that You're using `Debian GNU Linux` in the following steps.






## Production setup - using Docker / Kubernetes

To be prepared.
