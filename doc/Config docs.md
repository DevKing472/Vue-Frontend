# Vue Storefront configuration

Vue Storefront application uses the [node-config]() npm module to manage the configuration files. Configuration is stored in the `/config` directory within the two JSON files:
- `default.json` is a configuration file provided along with the core Vue Storefront code and updated with any new release of Vue Storefront. It contains the default values only and therefore it shoulnd't be modified within Your specific Vue Storefront instance.
- `local.json` is the second configuration file which is `.gitignore`'d from repository. This is the place where You should store all instance-specific configuration variables. 

The structure of these files is exactly the same! Vue Storefront does kind of `Object.assign(default, local)` (but with the deep-merge!). This means that the `local.json` overrides the `default.json` properties.

**Note:** Please take a look at the `node-config` docs as the library is open for some other ways to modify the configuration (using for example the `ENV` variables).

**Note:** By default the configuration is being bundled by webpack and can not be modified without re-compiling Vue Storefront. This limitation can by however solved with VS 1.4 - special config variable. Now the config can be reloaded on-fly with each server request if `config.server.dynamicConfigReload` is set to true. However in that case the config is added to `window.__INITIAL_STATE__` with the responses.

## Vue Storefront configuration file - explained

Please find the configuration properties reference below.

```json
    "server": {
      "host": "localhost",
      "port": 3000
    },
```
Vue Storefront starts a HTTP server to deliver the SSR (server side rendered) pages and static assets. It's node.js server located in the `core/scripts/server.js`. This is the host name and TCP port which Vue Storefront is being bind to.

```json
    "elasticsearch": {
      "httpAuth": "",
      "host": "localhost:8080/api/catalog",
      "index": "vue_storefront_catalog"
    },
```
Vue Storefront uses the Elastic Search Query Language to query for data. However, here You're putting the Vue Storefront API `/api/catalog` endpoint which is kind of Elastic Search Proxy (dealing with the taxes, security itd.).

If Your `vue-storefront-api` instance is running on the `localhost`, port `8080` then the corrent elasticsearch endpoint is as presented here.

```json
    "ssr": {
      "executeMixedinAsyncData": true
    },
```
By default Vue Storefront themes are created by building set of components that "mixins" the core-components. For example You have `/src/themes/default/pages/Product.vue` which component inherits the `/core/pages/Product.js` by having this core componnt included in the `"mixins": [Product]` section. 

The SSR data is being completed in the `asyncData` static method. If this configuration parameter is set to true (which is default) Vue Storefront will run the `asyncData` methods in the following sequence:
`core/pages/Product.js` -> `asyncData`
`src/themes/default/pages/Product.vue` -> `asyncData`

If it's set to false, then JUST THE `src/themes/default/pages/Product.vue` -> `asyncData` will be executed.
This option is referenced in the [`core/client-entry.ts`](../core/client-entry.ts) line: 85.

```json
    "defaultStoreCode": "",
```
This option is used only in the [Multistore setup](Multistore setup.md). By default its '' but if You're running for example multi-instance Vue Storefront setup and the current instance shall be connected to the `en` store on the backend - plese just set it so. This config variable is referenced in the [`core/store/lib/multistore.js`](../core/store/lib/multistore.js)

```json
    "storeViews": {
      "multistore": false,
      "mapStoreUrlsFor": ["de", "it"],
```
If the `storeViews.multistore` is set to true You'll see the LanguageSwitcher.vue included in the footer and all the [multistore operations](Multistore setup.md) will be included in the request flow.

You should add all the multistore codes to the `mapStoreUrlsFor` as this property is used by [`core/store/lib/multistore.js`](../core/store/lib/multistore.js) -> `setupMultistoreRoutes` method to add the `/<store_code>/p/....` and other standard routes. By accesing them You're [instructing Vue Storefront to switch the current store](../core/client-entry.ts) settings (i18n, api requests with specific storeCode etc...

`storeViews` section contains one or more additional store views configures to serve proper i18n translations, tax settings etc. Please find the docs for this section - below.

```json
      "de": {
        "storeCode": "de",
```
```json        
        "disabled": true,
```
If specific store is disabled it won't be used to puplate the routing table and won't be displayed in the `Language/Switcher.vue`.

```json
        "storeId": 3,
```
This is the `storeId` as set in the backend panel. This parameter is being used by some API calls to get the specific store currency and/or tax settings.

```json  
        "name": "German Store",
```
This is the store name as displayed in the `Language/Switcher.vue`.

```json
        "url": "/de",
```
This URL is used only in the `Switcher` component. Typically it equals just to `/<store_code>`. Sometimes You may like to have the different store views running as separate Vue Storefront instances; even under different URL addresses. This is the situation when this property comes into action. Just take a look on how [Language/Switcher.vue](../src/themes/default/components/core/blocks/Switcher/Language.vue) generates the list of the stores.

```json
        "elasticsearch": {
          "host": "localhost:8080/api/catalog",
          "index": "vue_storefront_catalog_de"
        },
```
ElasticSearch settings can be overriden in the specific storeView config. That's is. You Can use different ElasticSearch instance powering specific storeView.

```json
        "tax": {
          "sourcePriceIncludesTax": false,          
          "defaultCountry": "DE",
          "defaultRegion": "",
          "calculateServerSide": true
        },
```
Taxes section is used by the [`core/store/lib/taxcalc.js`](..core/store/lib/taxcalc.js). When `sourcePricesIncludesTax` is set to true it means that the prices indexed in the ElasticSearch already consists of the taxes. If it's set to false the taxes will be calculated runtime.

The `defaultCountry` and the `defaultRegion` settings are being used for finding the proper tax rate for the anynomous unidentified user (which country is not set yet).

```json
        "i18n": {
          "fullCountryName": "Germany",
          "fullLanguageName": "German",
          "defaultLanguage": "DE",
          "defaultCountry": "DE",
          "defaultLocale": "de-DE",
          "currencyCode": "EUR",
          "currencySign": "EUR",
          "dateFormat": "HH:mm D-M-YYYY"
        }
      }
    },
```
The internationalization settings are used by the translation engine (`defautlLocale`) and the [Language/Switcher.vue](../src/themes/default/components/core/blocks/Switcher/Language.vue) (`fullCountryName`, `fullLanguageName`). `currencyCode` is used for some of the API calls (rendering prices mostly) and `currencySign` is being used for displaying the prices in the frontend.

```json
    "entities": {
      "optimize": true,
```
If this option is set to true, Vue Storefront will be limiting the data got from the API endpoints to the `includeFields` and remove all the `excludeFields` as set for all the specific entities below. This option is set to true by default as the JSON objects could ... be of significant size! 

This option property is referenced in the [`core/store/modules/product`](../core/store/module/product), [`core/store/modules/category`](../core/store/module/category), [`core/store/modules/attribute`](../core/store/module/attribute)

```json
      "twoStageCaching": true,
```
Vue Storefront caches all the data entities got from vue-storefront-api into indexedDB local cache. This is key feature for providing usets with the offline mode. Unfortunatelly, when the `entities.optimize` option is set to true - we cannot cache the optimized entites as they don't contain all the required information.

In such a case we're using a strategy called `twoStageCaching` which works like it executes two parallel server requests at once to get the required product, category or attribute feeds. The first request is with the limited fields and the second is for full records. Only the second request is cached BUT the first which typically ends-up faster is used for displaying the Cateogry or Product page.

Please take a look at the [`core/store/modules/category`](../core/store/modules/category) for the reference.

```json
      "optimizeShoppingCart": true,
```
Vue Storefront product objects can be quite large ones. They consist of `configurable_children`, `media_gallery` and other information. Quite significant for renderinf the product and category pages but not so usefull in the shooping cart. To limit the shopping cart size (as it's transfered to the server while making an order) this option is being used. 

Please take a look at the [`core/store/modules/cart`](../core/store/modules/cart).

```json
      "category": {
        "includeFields": [ "children_data", "id", "children_count", "sku", "name", "is_active", "parent_id", "level", "url_key", "product_count" ]
      },
      "attribute": {
        "includeFields": [ "attribute_code", "id", "entity_type_id", "options", "default_value", "is_user_defined", "frontend_label", "attribute_id", "default_frontend_label", "is_visible_on_front", "is_visible", "is_comparable" ]
      },
      "productList": {
        "sort": "",
        "includeFields": [ "type_id", "sku", "product_links", "tax_class_id", "special_price", "special_to_date", "special_from_date", "name", "price", "priceInclTax", "originalPriceInclTax", "originalPrice", "specialPriceInclTax", "id", "image", "sale", "new", "url_key", "status" ],
        "excludeFields": [ "configurable_children", "description", "configurable_options", "sgn" ]
      },
      "productListWithChildren": {
        "includeFields": [ "type_id", "sku", "name", "tax_class_id", "special_price", "special_to_date", "special_from_date", "price", "priceInclTax", "originalPriceInclTax", "originalPrice", "specialPriceInclTax", "id", "image", "sale", "new", "configurable_children.image", "configurable_children.sku", "configurable_children.price", "configurable_children.special_price", "configurable_children.priceInclTax", "configurable_children.specialPriceInclTax", "configurable_children.originalPrice", "configurable_children.originalPriceInclTax", "configurable_children.color", "configurable_children.size", "configurable_children.id", "product_links", "url_key", "status"],
        "excludeFields": [ "description", "sgn"]
      },
      "product": {
        "excludeFields": [ "updated_at", "created_at", "attribute_set_id", "tier_prices", "options_container", "msrp_display_actual_price_type", "has_options", "stock.manage_stock", "stock.use_config_min_qty", "stock.use_config_notify_stock_qty", "stock.stock_id",  "stock.use_config_backorders", "stock.use_config_enable_qty_inc", "stock.enable_qty_increments", "stock.use_config_manage_stock", "stock.use_config_min_sale_qty", "stock.notify_stock_qty", "stock.use_config_max_sale_qty", "stock.use_config_max_sale_qty", "stock.qty_increments", "small_image"],
        "includeFields": null
      }
    },
```
These settings are used just to configure the optimization strategy for different entitiy types. Please take a look that we have `productListWithChildren` and the `product` configuration separately. The former one is used in the Category page -> `core/pages/Category.js` and the ladder is used in the Product page ->`core/pages/Product.js`

```json
    "cart": {
      "server_merge_by_default": true,
```
Server cart is being synchronized with the client's cart in the Vue Storefront by default. When it's not set the Vue Storefront will execute the server cart merge algorithm anyway - but using the `dryRun` option which means that only the following event will be emited: 

```js
    EventBus.$emit('servercart-after-diff', { diffLog: diffLog, serverItems: serverItems, clientItems: clientItems, dryRun: event.dry_run, event: event }) // send the difflog
```

In the event handler one can handle the merge proess manually - for example displaing the proper information to the user before the real merge takes place.

Please take a look at the [`core/store/modules/cart`](../core/store/modules/cart) for a reference.

```json
      "synchronize": true,
```
If it's set to true the `serverPull` Vuex method will be executed whenever user adds, remove or edits any product in the shopping cart. This method syncs the client's side shopping cart with the server side one.

Please take a look at the [`core/store/modules/cart`](../core/store/modules/cart) for a reference.

```json
      "synchronize_totals": true,
```
Similarly to the `synchronize` option You may wan't to disable or enable (the default behaviour) the shopping cart totals sync with the backend platform. If it's set to true the shopping cart totals will be overriden by the Magento, Pimcore or any other platform You're using totals whenever user will add, remove or change any item in the shopping cart.

```json      
      "setCustomProductOptions": true,
```
If this option is set to true, in case of custom-options supporting products, Vue Storefront will add the main SKU to the shopping cart and set the `product_option` sub-object of the shopping cart item to currently configured set of custom options (for example selected dates, checkboxes, captions or other values).

```json
      "setConfigurableProductOptions": true,
```
If this option is set to true, in case of configurable products, Vue Storefront will add the main SKU to the shopping cart and set the `product_option` sub-object of the shopping cart item to currently configured set of configurable options (for example color and size). otherwise the simple product (accordingly to the selected configurable_options) will be added to the shopping cart instead.

```json
      "create_endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/api/cart/create?token={{token}}",
      "updateitem_endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/api/cart/update?token={{token}}&cartId={{cartId}}",
      "deleteitem_endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/api/cart/delete?token={{token}}&cartId={{cartId}}",
      "pull_endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/api/cart/pull?token={{token}}&cartId={{cartId}}",
      "totals_endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/api/cart/totals?token={{token}}&cartId={{cartId}}",
      "paymentmethods_endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/api/cart/payment-methods?token={{token}}&cartId={{cartId}}",
      "shippingmethods_endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/api/cart/shipping-methods?token={{token}}&cartId={{cartId}}",
      "shippinginfo_endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/api/cart/shipping-information?token={{token}}&cartId={{cartId}}",
      "collecttotals_endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/api/cart/collect-totals?token={{token}}&cartId={{cartId}}",
      "deletecoupon_endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/api/cart/delete-coupon?token={{token}}&cartId={{cartId}}",
      "applycoupon_endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/api/cart/apply-coupon?token={{token}}&cartId={{cartId}}&coupon={{coupon}}"
```      
These endpoints should point to the `vue-storefront-api` instance and typically You're chaning just the domain-name/base-url without touching the specific endpoint urls as it's related to the `vue-storefront-api` specifics.

```json
"products": {
      "useShortCatalogUrls": false,
```
When this option is set to true, Vue Storefront will use the alternative routing for products and categories - without the `/p/` and `/c/` prefixes. it may be usefull for the Search Engine Optimization purposes.

```json
      "useMagentoUrlKeys": false,
```
When `useMagentoUrlKeys` is set to true the `product.url_key` value will be used for as for product and category slug's used in the URL building process. Otherwise the slug will be generated based on the product or category name.
Please take a look at the [`core/store/lib/search.js`](../core/store/lib/search.js) and [`core/store/modules/category/mutations.js`](../core/store/modules/category/mutations.js) for reference

```json      
      "configurableChildrenStockPrefetchStatic": false,
      "configurableChildrenStockPrefetchStaticPrefetchCount": 8,
```
Vue Storefronts tries to dynamically get the stock quantities for simple products related to the configurable one's (products included in the `configurabe_children` array). If the `configurableChildrenStockPrefetchStatic` is set to true - the stock items are prefetched from the Category page level. Please take a look at the [`core/store/modules/category/actions.js`](../core/store/modules/category/actions.js). The second option - `configurableChildrenStockPrefetchStaticPrefetchCount` sets how many products in the category should be prefetched using this mechanism.

```json
      "configurableChildrenStockPrefetchDynamic": false,
```
In oposite to the static prefetching Vue Storefront could also prefetch the configurable_children stock items just for the products that are visible on the category Page. This option is used from the theme level - for example [`src/themes/default/pages/Category.vue`](../src/themes/default/pages/Category.vue)
```json
      "filterUnavailableVariants": false,
```
By default Vue Storefront displays all the variants assigned with the configurable product, no matter if they are visible or not. Then - by adding specific variant to the shopping cart the availability is being check. You can switch this setting to true to prefetch the variants availability (see the options described above) and hide unavailable options.

```json
      "listOutOfStockProducts": false,
```
By default Vue Storefront is not displaying the products with the stock availability = 'Out of the stock'. However it can be changed using this variable. Vue Storefront uses the `product.stock` object to access the product information availability. Please note that this information is updated just when the `mage2vuestorefront` updates the ElasticSearch index.

```json
      "preventConfigurableChildrenDirectAccess": true,
```
If this option is set to true (default) Vue Storefront will prevent accesing the simple products assigned with the configurable one. User will be redirected to the main configurable product in such a case.

```json      
      "alwaysSyncPlatformPricesOver": false,
```
This property is used in the [`core/store/modules/product/actions.js`](../core/store/modules/product/actions.js); if it's set to true Vue Storefront will query the `vue-storefront-api` endpoint (`/api/products/render-list`) to render the product prices for currently displayed product(s) EACH TIME user is about to display the product or category page.

```json
      "clearPricesBeforePlatformSync": false,
```
This is related to `alwaysSyncPlatformPricesOver` and whet it's set to true, the prices provided from the ElasticSearch will be always overriden to zero before rendering the dynamic prices.

```json
      "waitForPlatformSync": false,
```
This is related to `alwaysSyncPlatformPricesOver`. When true, Vue Storefront will wait for dynamic prices before rendering the page. Otherwise the product and category pages will be rendered using the default (ElasticSearch based) prices and then asynchronosuly override them with current ones.

```json
      "setupVariantByAttributeCode": true,
```
This is deprecated value - when set to fals, Vue Storefront will be using `slugify(attribute.name)` instead of `attribute.attribute_code` to construct filter and product configurators. It was provided to maintain the backward compatibility with some platforms that didn't provide the `attribute_code` property. Currently not used.

```json
      "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/api/product",
```
This is the `vue-storefront-api` endpoint for rendering the product lists.

```json
      "defaultFilters": ["color", "size", "price", "erin_recommends"],
```
`defaultFilters` array should contain ALL the filters that could be used in the [Sidebar menu filters](../src/themes/default/components/core/blocks/Category/Sidebar.vue).

```json
      "sortByAttributes": {
        "Latest": "updated_at",
        "Price":"price"
      },
```
Here we have the sort field settings as they're displayed on the Category page.

```json
  "gallery": {
      "mergeConfigurableChildren": true
```

Vue Storefront is feeding the Product page gallery with the combination of: `product.media_gallery`, `product.image` and the `product.configurable_children.image`, if false the Product page gallery shows the `product.media_gallery` of the selected variant.

```json
  "gallery": {
      "variantsGroupAttribute": "color"
```
If "mergeConfigurableChildren" is set to true In some cases simple products attached to the configurable one have the same photos as the main one assigned. If this option is set to the name of any particullar attribute assigned with `configurable_children` - the images that Vue Storefront is getting will be grouped by the color (getting single color images from the `configurable_children` collection)

```json
   "gallery": {
     "imageAttributes": ["image","thumbnail","small_image"]
```

The product attributes representing the images. Wee see it in the Product page gallery if `mergeConfigurableChildren` is set to false and the product is configured 

```json
  "gallery": {
      "width": 600,
      "height": 744
```

The dimensions of the images in the gallery

```json
    "orders": {
      "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/api/order",
```
This property sets the URL of the order endpoint. Orders will be placed to this specific URL as soon as the interenet is available.

```json      
      "payment_methods_mapping": {
      },
```     
This is simple map used in the [`core/pages/Checkout.js`](../core/pages/Checkout.js) to map the payment methods provided by the backend service with the one's available to the Vue storefront. Each payment method is a separate Vue Storefront extension and not all methods provided by the backend should necesserly be supported by the frontend.

```json
      "offline_orders": {
        "notification" : {
          "enabled": true,
          "title" : "Order waiting!",
          "message": "Click here to confirm the order that you made offline.",
          "icon": "/assets/logo.png"
        }
      }
```      
When user places order in the Offline mode an agrees to get the push notifications, these variables are used to determine the look and feel of the notification.

Please check the [`core/service-worker/order.js`](../core/service-worker/order.js) for reference

```json
    "localForage": {
      "defaultDrivers": {
        "user": "LOCALSTORAGE",
        "carts": "LOCALSTORAGE",
        "orders": "LOCALSTORAGE",
        "wishlist": "INDEXEDDB",
        "categories": "INDEXEDDB",
        "attributes": "INDEXEDDB",
        "products": "INDEXEDDB",
        "elasticCache": "INDEXEDDB",
        "claims": "LOCALSTORAGE",        
        "compare": "INDEXEDDB",        
        "syncTasks": "INDEXEDDB",        
        "ordersHistory": "INDEXEDDB",
        "checkoutFieldValues": "LOCALSTORAGE"
      }
    },
```
We're using `localForage` library for provide the persistance layer to Vue Storefront. `localForage` is great as it provides the compatibility fallbacks for the users not equiped with some specific storage methods (for example indexedDb). However, we may want to enforce some specific storage methods in the config. This is the place to set it up.

```json
    "users": {
      "autoRefreshTokens": true,
      "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/api/user",
      "history_endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/api/user/order-history?token={{token}}",
      "resetPassword_endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/api/user/reset-password",
      "changePassword_endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/api/user/change-password?token={{token}}",
      "login_endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/api/user/login",
      "create_endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/api/user/create",
      "me_endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/api/user/me?token={{token}}",
      "refresh_endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/api/user/refresh"
    },
```
In the `users` section we can set the API endpoints for specific use-related operations. Most of the times You need to just change the basic url.

When the `autoRefreshTokens` property is set to true (default) Vue Storefront will be trying to refresh the user tokens automatically when the session ends up. Please take a look at the [`core/store/lib/task.js`](../core/store/lib/task.js) for reference.

```json
    "stock": {
      "synchronize": true,
      "allowOutOfStockInCart": true,
      "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080/api/stock"
    },
```
The stock section configures how the Vue Storefront behaves JUST WHEN the product is being added to the cart. By default the request to `stock.endpoint` is being made asynchronosuly to the add to cart operation. Then the `allowOutOfStockInCart` is set to true, and the product is no longer available - then it will be removed from the cart (with a proper UI notification) shortly after the information become available to the Vue Storefront.

```json
    "images": {
      "baseUrl": "https://demo.vuestorefront.io/img/",
      "productPlaceholder": "/assets/placeholder.jpg"
    },
```
This section is to set the default base url of product images. This should be a `vue-storefront-api` url - pointing to it's `/api/img` handler. Vue Storefront API is in charge of downloading the local image cache from the Magento/Pimcore ... backend and do the resize/crop/scale operations to optimize the images for mobile devices and the UI.

```json
    "install": {
      "is_local_backend": true,
      "backend_dir": "../vue-storefront-api"
    },
```
This is just to be used in the [`core/scripts/installer.js`](../core/scripts/installer.js)

```json
    "demomode": false,
```
When `demomode` is set to true, Vue Storefront will display the "Welcome to Vue Storefront demo" popup

```json
        "tax": {
          "sourcePriceIncludesTax": false,          
          "defaultCountry": "DE",
          "defaultRegion": "",
          "calculateServerSide": true
        },

Taxes section is used by the [`core/store/lib/taxcalc.js`](..core/store/lib/taxcalc.js). When `sourcePricesIncludesTax` is set to true it means that the prices indexed in the ElasticSearch already consists of the taxes. If it's set to false the taxes will be calculated runtime.
