# 1.0 -> 1.1 change list

# Modifications

## Plugins registration simplified

Instead of exporting an object in `{theme}/plugins/index.js` just use `Vue.use(pugin)` directly in this file ( [docs](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/master/doc/Working%20with%20plugins.md) )

# New features

We added [`vue-progressbar`](https://github.com/hilongjw/vue-progressbar) to default theme which can be found in `App.vue` file
