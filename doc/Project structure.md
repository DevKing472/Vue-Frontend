# Project structure

## Using git for custom development

One of the options is to do kind of fork - or just to get the whole repo to your Git service. Then if you like to do some VS updates you probably need to just pull the changes from our origins. Another option will be available as soon as we manage to separate the core as a npm module

## Structure details

Below you can find the Vue Storefront project structure with explainations and corresponding docs. This is a good place to start with the project.

* `config/` - Config files for vue storefront. They're used to define backend addreses, current theme etc.
  * `default.json` - Default config tempalte which should never be changed. If you want to make some changes in config create `local.json` file in the same folder, copy the content and make changes here. Default `config.json` will be overwritten by `local.json` for your setup.
  * `local.json` (optional) - your custom Vue Storefront config
* `doc` - Project documentation
* `core` - Vue Storefront core <b>(don't modify this directory on your project if you want to receive core updates)</b>

  * `build/` -  It contains `config.json` generated from files in `/config` folder and webpack build,. Its made from vue-cli webpack tempate. You can extend core webpack build in '{themeroot}/webpack.config.js' (related: [Working with Webpack](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/blob/master/doc/Working%20with%20webpack.md)).
